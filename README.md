Database Application_Car Rental Management System

In this century, more and more traditional services became digitized. It could help people to use these services in a more convenient way. In addition, allowing the organization to manage its service more easily. Car rental service is one of the examples. In the past, people were required to go to the service provider physically to rent a car. Thanks to technological advancement, people can rent a car in 5 minutes and can be done on their mobile phone. Based on this inspiration, the team has decided to build a database management system for the car rental service. In this application, there are four pages which are the home page, booking management page, car management page, and user management page. Users can insert data into the database, delete data, search data by specific conditions, update data, and view the data statistics on these pages. The database of the car rental service will be deployed and hosted on the GCP(Google Cloud Platform) SQL database. The database contains three tables which are the User table, Car table, and Booking table.
